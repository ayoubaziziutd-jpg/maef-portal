# MAFS: Moroccan American Financial Support
### التضامن - Solidarity

**"Takaful: Because We Are One Body, One Shield."**

## 🛡️ The Mission
Life is a journey of peaks and valleys, and the storm often arrives unannounced. At MAFS, we don’t just provide a policy; we provide a promise. Rooted in the Prophetic tradition of Takaful, our support acts as a communal shield against the unexpected.
